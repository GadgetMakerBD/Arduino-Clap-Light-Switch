- Microphone sound sensor module
- Relay module (to control light)
- LED (for indication)
- Jumper wires
- Breadboard or PCB

## 📝 How It Works

- The microphone detects **claps** as sound pulses.
- If **two claps** are detected within a short time (but spaced out enough), the relay toggles.
- LED on pin 13 indicates clap detection.
